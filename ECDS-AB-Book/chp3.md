+ Chp3.1 
   + exercise: write the result in case where all little m and n and terminal T vanish. only M(t) an N(t) show in the payoff.
   + proof:  inequality (3.1.12)
 
+ Chp3.2 
  + exercise: write the result for discounted infinite horizon problem.
  + why Eq.(3.2.7) is the key in proof
  + What is lower solution? What is minimum/maximum solution?
  + Why Eq.(3.2.3)is not unique ? Give an example.
  + Is the minimum solution of (3.2.3) unique ?
