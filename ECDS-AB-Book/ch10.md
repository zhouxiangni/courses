+ 10.1 **PMP**

+ On pertubation ( Chapter II, Section 10, p38, in [FR])
  + on initial state (strong variation): linearized system.  Jacobi matrix 
  + on control/forcing (weak variation): then add derivative w.r.t. control variable 
  
+ pertubation on control:  strong variation (spike modification Section 10.1.2)and weak variation(Gateaux differential Section 10.1.3): 
  + strong variation is the pertubation at initial state:  Theorem 11.3 in [FR] with more details on eqn(10.1.16)
  + adjoint state p(t) (10.1.10) and (10.1.11):  if without the running cost, its i the same as Ex2.1, p6 for the first order pertubation of the state $\delta x$
 
+ Step in Proof MPM Theorem 10.1

  1. apply spike perturbation in strong variation at an arbitrary time $t_0$
  2. derive $z$ as the first order approximaton of the perturbed state variable
  3. expand the payoff function $J$ up to the first order 
  4. use adjoint equation to transform the state pertubation $z$ to the perturbed control $v$.
 
+ Gateaux differential: standard, note the same role of adjoint state

+ 10.3  adjoint variable is the gradient of value function
