Estimation and Control of Dynamical Systems的书的安排 (focus on a few **chapters**)：
+  1， 2-3: **linear dynamical system**  -->  [CAI ZHIQIANG]
    + linear ODE;   fundamental matrix; controbability; stability; observability; 
  
  
+ 4-5:   estimation, system identification, bayesian, mean square, MLE

+ 6-7: can be found in any stochastic prob. book and skipped

+ 8-9 : **stochastic control of linear SDE** || parallel to  2-3  [HAN JIAYUE]
   +  LQR problem ; separation principle 
   
+ 10:  **deterministic optimal control** -> companian  reading:  Flemming&Soner:Controlled Markov Process & Viscosity Solution and  Flemming&Rishel: DeterminisiticStochasitcOptimalControl

   *split into two sessions* 
   
    +  PMP  vs  DPP
    +  HJB; verification principle 
  
+ 11:  **stochastic optimal control** -> companian reading:  Flemming&Soner:Controlled Markov Process & Viscosity Solution and  Flemming&Rishel: DeterminisiticStochasitcOptimalControl

   *split into three sections*   
    +  Gateaux differential formula ; adjoint state; BSDE; stochastic PMP
    +  HJB equation; uniqueness theorem; well-posedness theorem ; policy iteration technique
