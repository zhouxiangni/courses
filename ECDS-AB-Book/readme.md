Alain Bensoussan
Estimation and Control of Dynamical Systems的书的安排 (focus on a few **chapters**)：

+  This is *not* a book for the beginner reader; the best is to start with the following two books (which share some common parts a lot)

     1. Flemming&Soner:Controlled Markov Process & Viscosity Solution 
     2. Flemming&Rishel: DeterminisiticStochasitcOptimalControl
        
+  Purpose/Intended Outcome:  
        
        1. Familarize the languages and the precise meanings of important concepts and definitions. 
        2. Start from linear quadratic regulator problems in various settings as a good introductory step to the general and theoretic studes.
        3. Build the knowledge graph on *theories* in optimal control (with the supplementation of the above two text books)
        4. Review the learnt math (Chapter 6/7) or fill in the void.
